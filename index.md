Welcome Candidates. Below are the purpose of the small task you are about face (making a simple gallery app) before proceeding to our face-to-face interview:

* We want to know if you are serious about the application. If you don't already know what we do and not sure about your future. I suggest you take some time to check our our [website](http://revenuemonster.my) first. Think about if this is something that interest you or not. **Life is short, do what you love.**

* This small task tells us if you are **willing to learn new technology** or work with open source technology. As React Native is fairly new, it does require some learning if you have not played with it before.

* It examines your **programming styles and your sense of design**. We love to write beautiful code and build awesome looking applications. 

* It examines your understanding of basic **API programming and basic front end development**.

* We will talk about the small app during our interview about **coding styles, thoughts behind designs** and get to know you better. 

* **Don't be afraid.** It's a learning opportunity, you could still use it as a portfolio regardless the outcome of the interview :)
