# [](#header-1)Welcome Candidates (Pre-Interview)
 Kindly follow the steps below and complete the gallery app task before proceeding to our face-to-face interview:

* We want to know if you are serious about the application. Check out our [website](http://revenuemonster.my) to get a general gist of what we do before you proceed. Give it a real good thought if this is something that would interest you for at least 2-3 years. **Life is short, do what you love.**

* Are you **willing to constantly keep up with the latest technology** and work with open sourced
technology? React is fairly new in the market and it will require a little studying if you do not have the
experience prior to this.

* The task examines your **programming styles and your sense of design**. We love to write beautiful code and build awesome looking applications. 

* The task examines your understanding of basic **API programming and basic front end development**.

* We will discuss about the small app during our interview about **coding styles, thoughts behind designs** and get to know you better. 

* **Don't be afraid.** It's a learning opportunity, you could still use it as a portfolio regardless the outcome of the interview. :)

# [](#header-1)Our Values:
We all grew up having dreams, but along the way were told to follow someone else’s success path because chasing the dream is too difficult.  “It’s impossible.”  If you don’t listen to what they say, you are the odd ones.

We don’t believe great success can be achieved by bought overnight. It’s earned through countless days and nights, passionately working on those ideas that people say are “too difficult” or “impossible.” We are a group of odd ones who speak the truths, dream big dreams and do the impossible. 

We learn together, we support each other. Welcome to the Revenue Monster family.

We believe in team effort. There is no single hero but only when we unite towards the same vision we are a superhero team.

The like-minded are welcomed to challenge them at a place that encourages learning, respect effort, and value integrity. Detailed to perfection is in our genes and we will take no compromises. If you still have that spark in you and believe in what we believe. Join us, the odd ones. Let’s ignite the future!
