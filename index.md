# [](#header-1) Our Values :

We all grew up having dreams, but along the way were told to follow someone else’s success path because chasing the dream is too difficult. “It’s impossible.” If you don’t listen to what they say, you are the odd ones.

We don’t believe great success can be achieved overnight nor it can be bought. It’s earned through countless days and nights, passionately working on those ideas that people say are “too difficult” or “impossible.” We are a group of odd ones who speak the truths, dream big dreams and do the impossible.

We learn together, we support each other. Welcome to the Revenue Monster family.

We believe in team effort. There is no single hero but only when we unite towards the same vision we are a superhero team.

The like-minded are welcomed to challenge them at a place that encourages learning, respect effort, and value integrity. Detailed to perfection is in our genes and we will make no compromises. As mentioned, **dream** and **vision** are our main objective, we believe we can build something as big as [**Ant Financial**](https://www.antfin.com/index.htm?locale=en_US). If you still have that spark in you and believe in what we believe. Join us, the odd ones. Let’s ignite the future!
