# [](#header-1)Welcome Candidates (Pre-Interview)
 Below are the purpose of the small task you are about face (making a simple gallery app) before proceeding to our face-to-face interview:

* We want to know if you are serious about the application. If you don't already know what we do, check our our [website](http://revenuemonster.my) first. Think about if this is something that really interest you or not. **Life is short, do what you love.**

* This small task tells us if you are **willing to learn new technology** or work with open source technology. As React is fairly new, it does require some learning if you have not prior experience.

* It examines your **programming styles and your sense of design**. We love to write beautiful code and build awesome looking applications. 

* It examines your understanding of basic **API programming and basic front end development**.

* We will talk about the small app during our interview about **coding styles, thoughts behind designs** and get to know you better. 

* **Don't be afraid.** It's a learning opportunity, you could still use it as a portfolio regardless the outcome of the interview. :)

# [](#header-1)Our Values:
We all grew up having a dream or many dreams, but along the way were told to live someone else’s life because chasing the dream is too difficult.  “It’s impossible.”  If you don’t listen to what they say, you are the odd ones.

We don’t believe great success can be achieved by money, connection or glorified PowerPoints overnight. It’s earned through countless days and nights, passionately working on those ideas that people say are “too difficult” or “impossible.” We are a group of odd ones who speak the truths, dream the dreams and do the impossible. 

We learn together, we support each other. Welcome to the revenue monster family.

We believe in team effort. There is no superhero but only when we unite towards the same vision we are a superhero team.

The like-minded are welcome to challenge them at a place that encourages learning, respect effort, and value integrity. Detailed to perfection is in our genes and we will take no compromises. If you still have that spark and believe in the same values. Join us, the odd ones. Let’s ignite the future!
